\title{Read a BED file}
\usage{
read_bed(file, col_names = def_names("bed"), col_types = def_types("bed"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Either a path to a file, a connection, or literal data
(either a single string or a raw vector).

Files ending in \code{.gz}, \code{.bz2}, \code{.xz}, or \code{.zip} will
be automatically uncompressed. Files starting with \code{http://},
\code{https://}, \code{ftp://}, or \code{ftps://} will be automatically
downloaded. Remote gz files can also be automatically downloaded and
decompressed.

Literal data is most useful for examples and tests. It must contain at
least one new line to be recognised as data (instead of a path) or be a
vector of greater than length 1.

Using a value of \code{\link[readr:clipboard]{clipboard()}} will read from the system clipboard.}

\item{col_names}{column names to use. Defaults to \link{def_names("bed")}
compatible with blast tabular output (\verb{--outfmt 6/7} in blast++ and \code{-m8}
in blast-legacy). \link{def_names("bed")} can easily be combined with extra
columns: \code{col_names = c(def_names("bed"), "more", "things")}.}

\item{col_types}{One of \code{NULL}, a \code{\link[readr:cols]{cols()}} specification, or
a string. See \code{vignette("readr")} for more details.

If \code{NULL}, all column types will be imputed from the first 1000 rows
on the input. This is convenient (and fast), but not robust. If the
imputation fails, you'll need to supply the correct types yourself.

If a column specification created by \code{\link[readr:cols]{cols()}}, it must contain
one column specification for each column. If you only want to read a
subset of the columns, use \code{\link[readr:cols]{cols_only()}}.

Alternatively, you can use a compact string representation where each
character represents one column:
c = character, i = integer, n = number, d = double,
l = logical, f = factor, D = date, T = date time, t = time, ? = guess, or
\code{_}/\code{-} to skip the column.}
