\title{Pick seqs and bins by name or position}
\usage{
pick(x, ..., bins = everything())

pick_at(x, ..., bins = everything())

pick_bins(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{seqs to pick, select-like expression}

\item{bins}{to pick from, expression, enclose multiple args in c()}
}
\description{
Pick which sequences and bins to show and in what order. Uses
dyplr::select-like syntax, which means unquoted genome names, positional
arguments and select helper functions, such as `starts_with()` are
supported. Renaming is not supported because it would break associations with
other tracks.
}
\details{
Use the dots to select sequences, and the bins argument to set the scope for
positional arguments. For example, `pick(1)` will pick the first sequence
from the first bin, while `pick(1, bins=3)` will pick the first sequence from
the third bin.

`pick_at` keeps bins that are not picked from, as they are.

`pick_bins` works on entire bins.
