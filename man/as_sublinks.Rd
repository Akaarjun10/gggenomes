\title{Compute a layout for links linking feats}
\usage{
as_sublinks(x, seqs, feats, ..., everything = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{sublink data convertible to a link layout}

\item{seqs}{the sequence layout the linked feats map onto.}

\item{feats}{the feats the sublinks map onto.}

\item{...}{passed on to \code{layout_seqs()}}

\item{everything}{set to FALSE to drop optional columns}

\item{transform}{use if feats and sublinks are in different coordinate
spaces, i.e. if matching nucleotide-level annotations to protein level
annotations, e.g. genes and protein blast results.}
}
\value{
a tbl_df with plot coordinates
}
\description{
Reads sublinks connecting feats such as all-vs-all protein blasts into a
tidy dataframe. sublinks need to be associated with an already added feat
track. The sublinks are internally converted into a regular link track by
mapping the feat-based \code{start} and \code{end} coordinates to coordinates
relative to the sequences underlying the linked feats.
}
\details{
The only obligatory columns are \code{feat_id} & \code{feat_id2}. Also
recognized are \code{start/end}, \code{start2/end2} and \code{strand}.

Note \code{start} and \code{end} for every record will be coerced so that \code{start < end}. If no \code{strand} was provided, \code{strand} will be added and set to "+" for
records that initially had \verb{start < end == start2 < end2} and "-"
otherwise. If \code{strand} was provided, \code{start} and \code{end} will be reorganized to
conform with \code{start < end} without any additional effect.
